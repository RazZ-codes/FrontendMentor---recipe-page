## üõ†Ô∏è My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Custom list markers using `::marker`  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned
This was my first complete project on Frontend Mentor.  
I learned how to:
- Use `::marker` to style list bullets (`ul`) and ordered list numbers (`ol`).  
- Properly center a container with `display: flex` on the `body` without breaking the inner alignment.  
- Use `margin` and `line-height` for consistent spacing and readability.  
- Style tables with `border-bottom` and highlight specific cells using `td:last-child`.  

Here‚Äôs a code snippet I‚Äôm proud of:

```css
.instructions ol li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```
Continued development

I want to keep practicing:

CSS Grid (I relied mostly on Flexbox here).

Advanced responsiveness (tablet and very large screens).

Hosting local fonts with @font-face instead of only Google Fonts.

Useful resources
